## Description 📄
In this assignment, you will work solo with the help of AI to build an animal shelter webpage using Bootstrap. You'll create a navbar, animal cards, contact form and a footer. Use AI to assist with coding, design choices, and troubleshooting as you develop a responsive and accessible webpage with Bootstrap's built-in components.

## Expected Project Structure 🏗️

```plaintext

animalShelter/

├── index.html
├── styles.css

```
# Instructions ✅

## 1. **Create the Project Folder and Files**
   - [ ] Create a folder named `animalShelter` to store all your project files.
   
   - [ ] Inside the `animalShelter`` folder, create a file named `index.html`. This will be your main HTML file.
   
   - [ ] Also, in the `animalShelter` folder, create another file named `styles.css`. This file will contain the CSS used to style your HTML content.

## 2. **Start with a HTML Boilerplate**
Now that your files are set up, begin by adding the basic HTML boilerplate. 
We will also include the Bootstrap CDN links to streamline styling and layout.
